# Procfiles
A temiSaaS procfile is unlike most procfiles you've seen. Normally, a procfile declares the processes you'd like the server to run and that's it. This provides additional flexibility that allows you  to set up *exactly* how your processes are ran without much extra hassle. You can also configure shortcut commands that can be ran right over ssh with `command (pack name) (command) [args]`

Procfiles are yaml formatted
